 * in temp and frees buffer, that way we can calmly get the resulting line and
 * update buffer without leak preoccupations. We check that the duplicate was
 * created succesfully (or return NULL).
 * Now we assign the result of searching for a new line in the original buffer
 * (actual temp) in nl_pos (nl_pos = gnl_strchr(temp, '\n'))
 * Now, we check if there nl_pos is 0, which means that temp didn't contain any
 * new line. If it is 0, the resulting line will be the duplicate of the whole 
 * buffer (temp), so the new buffer will be empty (free temp) and finally we 
 * return the result (which is the resulting line). 
 * If there was a new line stored in the buffer (temp) (nl_pos != 0), we create
 * a substring of the old buffer (temp), from the beggining (0),
 * to the included nl_pos. After creating the substr we check that it was
 * created succesfully (otherwise we free temp and return NULL). 
 * We now update the new buffer to the correct one (deleting the resulting line
 * from the old buffer (temp)). To do that, we create a new substr of the old 
 * buffer (temp), from the '\n' (not included) (nl_pos) to the end of the old
 * buffer (ft_strlen(temp) - nl_pos). 
 * Now we can free temp since we have already updated the new buffer and then 
 * we check if the new buffer was created succesfully or not, if not, we free 
 * the new buffer.
 * Finally, we return the resulting line.

 * @retval NULL <- When any of the allocations for the string fails (making sure
 * to free any necessary variables first)

/**
 * @brief This function is made to read from the indicated fd and adding to the
 * buffer the read information by concatenating to the buffer itself.
 * @details First of all the function creates a new string called addbuf and
 * allocates BUFFER_SIZE + 1 memory to it. If the allocation fails, it frees the
 * original buffer and returns NULL. 
 * Then it assigns b_read to 1, which will represent the num of bytes read when 
 * using the read function. It starts from 1 in order to enter the while loop. 
 * The function will now run in loop until there is no more information to read 
 * in the fd (b_read = 0), the read fails (b_read == -1) or a '\n' is finally 
 * found inside buffer (gnl_strchr(buffer, '\n') != 0).
 * Inside the while loop we are going to start reading the indicated file
 * descriptor (reading BUFFER_SIZE characters in each call) and adding the read
 * information to addbuf (read(fd, addbuf, BUFFER_SIZE)). The function read
 * returns the number of characters read, which is why we are going to assing
 * its result to b_read. If it returns -1, it means there was an error during
 * the read call, which is why in such case we free both strings and return NULL
 * If the read called worked successfully, we add the '\0' character to the end
 * of addbuf in order to indicate the end of such string.
 * Now we can finally check that if something was read (b_read > 0) and the 
 * original buffer was empty (didnt exist: !buffer), then the new buffer will
 * be a duplicate of addbuf. If otherwise, there was something read (b_read > 0)
 * but buffer previously existed, then we concatenate addbuf to buffer by 
 * assigning doing: buffer = gnl_strjoin(buffer, addbuf).
 * This while loop will continuously repeat until one of its conditions isn't met
 * After the while loop, it finally frees addbuf and returns buffer.
 * @param buffer Buffer that needs to be updated during this function
 * @param fd File descriptor from which the function must read in order
 * to update the buffer
 * @retval NULL <- When the allocation of addbuf fails
 * @retval buffer <- Updated buffer
 * @warning Make sure to free buffer if the allocation of addbuf fails or
 * if the read function fails. Also make sure to free addbuf before returning
 * any value if you have succesfully allocated memory for it before.

 * If the buffer is empty/doesn't exist (usually happens on the first call of the
